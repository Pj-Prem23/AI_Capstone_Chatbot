# ðŸ¤– Capstone Project â€“ AI Chatbot with Data Science Integration

### ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains two main projects developed as part of my **M.Sc. Data Science Capstone**:
1. **Capstone_Project.ipynb** â€“ Data analysis and insights generation.
2. **ChatBot_Latest.ipynb** â€“ AI-powered chatbot using NLP techniques.

Both notebooks demonstrate the integration of **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Data Analytics** to create an intelligent conversational system with educational and practical use cases.
